# User Directory

For this project, I aim to create an employee directory with React. This assignment required a break up of the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. My main motivation for this project is to create an application that will allow employees or managers to view non-sensitive data about other employees. 

# User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

# Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

# Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:
    * Sort the table by at least one category.
    * Filter the users by at least one property.

# Installation
In order to use this app, you will need to use REACT.
